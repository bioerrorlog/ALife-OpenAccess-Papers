Abstract:  
> Life on Earth must originally have arisen from abiotic chemistry. Since the details of this chemistry are unknown, we wish to understand, in general, which types of chemistry can lead to complex, lifelike behavior. Here we show that even very simple chemistries in the thermodynamically reversible regime can self-organize to form complex autocatalytic cycles, with the catalytic effects emerging from the network structure. We demonstrate this with a very simple but thermodynamically reasonable artificial chemistry model. By suppressing the direct reaction from reactants to products, we obtain the simplest kind of autocatalytic cycle, resulting in exponential growth. When these simple first-order cycles are prevented from forming, the system achieves superexponential growth through more complex, higher-order autocatalytic cycles. This leads to nonlinear phenomena such as oscillations and bistability, the latter of which is of particular interest regarding the origins of life.

Abstract:  
> We introduce a spatial model of concentration dynamics that supports the emergence of spatiotemporal inhomogeneities that engage in metabolism–boundary co-construction. These configurations exhibit disintegration following some perturbations, and self-repair in response to others. We define robustness as a viable configuration's tendency to return to its prior configuration in response to perturbations, and plasticity as a viable configuration's tendency to change to other viable configurations. These properties are demonstrated and quantified in the model, allowing us to map a space of viable configurations and their possible transitions. Combining robustness and plasticity provides a measure of viability as the average expected survival time under ongoing perturbation, and allows us to measure how viability is affected as the configuration undergoes transitions. The framework introduced here is independent of the specific model we used, and is applicable for quantifying robustness, plasticity, and viability in any computational model of artificial life that demonstrates the conditions for viability that we promote.

Abstract:  
> RNA molecules engineered to fold into predefined conformations have enabled the design of a multitude of functional RNA devices in the field of synthetic biology and nanotechnology. More complex designs require efficient computational methods, which need to consider not only equilibrium thermodynamics but also the kinetics of structure formation. Here we present a novel type of RNA design that mimics the behavior of prions, that is, sequences capable of interaction-triggered autocatalytic replication of conformations. Our design was computed with the ViennaRNA package and is based on circular RNA that embeds domains amenable to intermolecular kissing interactions.

Abstract:  
> Cell-free expression is a technology used to synthesize minimal biological cells from natural molecular components. We have developed a versatile and powerful all-E. coli cell-free transcription–translation system energized by a robust metabolism, with the far objective of constructing a synthetic cell capable of self-reproduction. Inorganic phosphate (iP), a byproduct of protein synthesis, is recycled through polysugar catabolism to regenerate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and thus supports long-lived and highly efficient protein synthesis in vitro. This cell-free TX-TL system is encapsulated into cell-sized unilamellar liposomes to express synthetic DNA programs. In this work, we study the compartmentalization of cell-free TX-TL reactions, one of the aspects of minimal cell module integration. We analyze the signals of various liposome populations by fluorescence microscopy for one and for two reporter genes, and for an inducible genetic circuit. We show that small nutrient molecules and proteins are encapsulated uniformly in the liposomes with small fluctuations. However, cell-free expression displays large fluctuations in signals among the same population, which are due to heterogeneous encapsulation of the DNA template. Consequently, the correlations of gene expression with the compartment dimension are difficult to predict accurately. Larger vesicles can have either low or high protein yields.

### An Informational Study of the Evolution of Codes and of Emerging Concepts in Populations of Agents

Abstract:  
> We consider the problem of the evolution of a code within a structured population of agents. The agents try to maximize their information about their environment by acquiring information from the outputs of other agents in the population. A naive use of information-theoretic methods would assume that every agent knows how to interpret the information offered by other agents. However, this assumes that it knows which other agents it observes, and thus which code they use. In our model, however, we wish to preclude that: It is not clear which other agents an agent is observing, and the resulting usable information is therefore influenced by the universality of the code used and by which agents an agent is listening to. We further investigate whether an agent that does not directly perceive the environment can distinguish states by observing other agents' outputs. For this purpose, we consider a population of different types of agents talking about different concepts, and try to extract new ones by considering their outputs only.

### A General Statistical Method for Identifying Adaptations by Parameterizing Trait Space

Abstract:  
> It is obviously useful to think of evolved individuals in terms of their adaptations, yet the task of empirically classifying traits as adaptations has been claimed by some to be impossible in principle. I reject that claim by construction, introducing a formal method to empirically test whether a trait is an adaptation. The method presented is general, intuitive, and effective at identifying adaptations while remaining agnostic about their adaptive function. The test follows directly from the notion that adaptations arise from variation, heritability, and differential fitness in an evolving population: I operationalize these three concepts at the trait level, formally defining measures of individual traits. To test whether a trait is an adaptation, these measures are evaluated, locating the trait within a three-dimensional parameterized trait space. Within this space, I identify a region containing all adaptations; a trait's position relative to this adaptive region of trait space describes its status as an adaptation. The test can be applied in any evolving system where a few domain-specific statistical measures can be constructed; I demonstrate the construction of these measures, most notably a measure of an individual's hypothetical fitness if it were born with a different trait, in Packard's Bugs ALife model. The test is applied in Bugs, and shown to conform with our intuitive classification of adaptations.

### Population and Evolutionary Dynamics based on Predator–Prey Relationships in a 3D Physical Simulation

Abstract:  
> Recent studies have reported that population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics, occurring at different time scales, can be affected by each other. Our purpose is to explore the interaction between population and evolutionary dynamics using an artificial life approach based on a 3D physically simulated environment in the context of predator–prey and morphology–behavior coevolution. The morphologies and behaviors of virtual prey creatures are evolved using a genetic algorithm based on the predation interactions between predators and prey. Both population sizes are also changed, depending on the fitness. We observe two types of cyclic behaviors, corresponding to short-term and long-term dynamics. The former can be interpreted as a simple population dynamics of Lotka–Volterra type. It is shown that the latter cycle is based on the interaction between the changes in the prey strategy against predators and the long-term change in both population sizes, resulting partly from a tradeoff between their defensive success and the cost of defense.

Abstract:  
> Compliant bodies with complex dynamics can be used both to simplify control problems and to lead to adaptive reflexive behavior when engaged with the environment in the sensorimotor loop. By revisiting an experiment introduced by Beer and replacing the continuous-time recurrent neural network therein with reservoir computing networks abstracted from compliant bodies, we demonstrate that adaptive behavior can be produced by an agent in which the body is the main computational locus. We show that bodies with complex dynamics are capable of integrating, storing, and processing information in meaningful and useful ways, and furthermore that with the addition of the simplest of nervous systems such bodies can generate behavior that could equally be described as reflexive or minimally cognitive.
